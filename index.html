                iPhone X was meant to be the phone of the future. Released on September 12th, 2017, this phone would be the example for other phone brand companies. 
                A few things made this phone futuristic was that it was all display which gave users more space to use. With the newer previous phones, there had been a display around the screen either white or black.   
                 It also has a new face ID recognition that users had never seen before. The 7 megapixel TrueDepth made face recognition possible. According to Pocket-lint, TrueDepth camera system will detect your face with a flood illuminator. A flood
                 illuminator produces infrared lights to illuminate of your face. With that the camera will take an image on dot projector will project out over 30,000 infrared dots.
                 Animoji, a new feature, allows you to play around with emojis. <i>iPhone X</i> recognizes your facial movements and from there you can speak with them.

                    16 million sales. For the most part, Apple did not make phones in other colors than grey, black, silver, rose gold, and gold. 
                    <i>iPhone 11</i> has colors that would be appealing to users: red, yellow, green, purple, white and black.

                    This phone has 2 cameras, similar to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8. From the Apple website, "The dual-camera system lets users easily zoom between each camera while Audio Zoom matches the audio to the video framing for more dynamic 
                    sound.... to videos instantly all within the new, easy-to-use Camera interface." With this new phone you can take pictures in the dark and still get quality pictures. Similar to the iPhone X, it has Face ID recognition. This feature 
                    is 30% faster as well as the airdropping feature. Airdropping is when you can send pictures, videos, contacts and more to someone without having their number. IOS 7 and up support this and was made July 20 2011.
                </p>
                <li class=phoneversions><b>iPhone X vs <i>iPhone 11</i>:</b></li>
                    Compared to the iPhone X, the <i>iPhone 11</i> has 41 more battery hours which is a huge difference. The pixel density of this phone is about an thousand less than the X so the quality would be not as good. 
                    The screen size is bigger by 0.3 inches and bigger by 0.2 inches on height. All though some phone brands started putting dual cameras before Apple did a lot of companies started to put dual cameras on their 
                    products. This phone is still new so it's on their website. The phone costs about $600.

            <li>iPhone 12</li>
            <p>
                
                The 5th milestone for now is the iPhone 12. It came out not to long ago, October 23, 2020. It has a super retina XDR display "6.1". This phone has more a boxier look to it than the pervious iPhones because its edges are made it aluminum. Phones like the iPhone X, 11 and 6 plus weigh over 6 ounces. With this phone it was created to be the lightest 5G phone. Alike the iPhone 11, there are a variety of colors to pick from: black, white, red, green, blue and the newest, purple. 

            </p>
                <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/160866001@N07/50599657331">

            </p>
            <p>
                There isn't that much that changed with the device other than battery life. The hours of battery life is increasing with every new iPhone. The iPhone 12 can last 16 days while the iPhone 11 can only do 60 hours. There's an iPhone 
                12 Pro and Pro Max selling for $1,000. As time goes past older iPhones decrease in value. A phone that would've been $800 is most likely $500 or $400.  
            </p>

            <p>Many apple users were angry about what is inside the iPhone 12 box. Apple took out the lightning connector and lighting power cord, Reason being carbon emissions. This caused a negative reaction because most people wanted a new charger. 
                According to the article <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/160866001@N07/50599657331">Examining the Carbon Footprint of Devices by Srilatha</a>, it states that, "Manufacturing a smartphone accounts for 85%-95% of the annual carbon footprint of the phone, and the average smartphone requires 55 Kg of CO2e to 
                manufacture". We can see why Apple would want to decrease their emissions. Although many were angered the iPhone 12 still got 100 million unit sales.
